## Final Project 2: NBA players performances analyser
### Overview:
This business case is about how the NBA Celtics player manager can use data to make better player trades. A possible result might be some graphs showing the important characteristics of players that perform well in the Celtics team.
He is very interested in the topic of how to find and identify the right basketball players for a specific NBA team. It is always challenging to find the right players for the team, because different teams always have their own individual needs for players. In addition to that, the trend of the NBA is constantly changing, some years are more encouraged to defend, some years are more important to attack. We have to evaluate the player's future performance in the team based on his current characters like age, height, and draft information.
